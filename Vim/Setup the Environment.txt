HOW TO SETUP MY CUSTOM VIM ENVIRONMENT FROM SCRATCH

1: copy _vimrc to the appropriate user location (default is $HOME\_vimrc, type :version into vim to make sure)
2: copy vimfiles directory to $HOME (command window in %HOME: mklink /J vimfiles SkyDrive\vimfiles)
3: copy twilight to vim/colors


More information (In case you forgot):

_vimrc 	   	  : It contains the instructions vim executes when it is started, and calls for vimrc_example to also be executed.
vimrc_example.vim : called by _vimrc, it contains other instructions to be executed when vim is started.
pathogen          : a .vim file which once copied to $HOME\vimfiles\ takes care of installing NERDTree properly.
NERDTree	  : an improvement, installed by copying the nerdtree-master folder to $HOME\bundles\
twilight	  : a color scheme, installed by copying the twilight.vim file to the $VIM\colors\ folder


at the time of writing this help document:

$HOME\ is the same as C:\Users\daniel\
$VIM\  is the same as C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim74\colors
