Netplan is the new default network backend, which uses either networkd or NetworkManager as a frontend

the config file is in /etc/netplan/

an example file:

# save this in /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: NetworkManager
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    wifis:
        wlan0:
            optional: true
            dhcp4: true
            access-points:
                Flux:
                    password: examplepassword1
                eduroam:
                    auth:
                        key-management: eap
                        password: examplepassword2
                        method: peap
                        identity: exampleid@exampleserver.com
                        phase2-auth: mschapv2


after changing it, run
sudo netplan --debug try
