EXAMPLES
  Find a pattern in files
    grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
        # -r or -R is recursive,
        # -n is line number, and
        # -w stands for match the whole word.
        # -l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name
        #    of matching files
        # Along with these, --exclude, --include, --exclude-dir flags
        # could be used for efficient searching.

    grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
        # This will only search through those files which have .c or .h 
        # extensions.

    grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
        # This will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension:

    grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
        # For directories it's possible to exclude a particular directory(ies) through --exclude-dir parameter. For example, this will exclude the dirs dir1/, dir2/ and all of them matching *.dst/:
