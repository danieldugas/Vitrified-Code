EXAMPLES
  Submit job (defaults)
    bsub -W 4:00 -n 1 -R "rusage[ngpus_excl_p=0, mem=1024, scratch=0]" < script.sh
      # same as bsub < script.sh
      # -J name : assign job name
      # -B / -N : send an email at begin / end
      # -u user@email : use this email adress

  Submit interactive job
    bsub -Is -W 4:00 -R "rusage[ngpus_excl_p=1, mem=4096]" bash

  Forgot to add email notification
    bsub -N -W 00:01 -w "done(YOUR_JOB_ID)" -R light < empty_job.sh
      # -w is a pre-start condition (done(), started(), ...)

  Why is my job not started
    bjobs -p
      # "individual host-based reasons" means resources not available yet (ever?)

  Useful Commands
    bbjobs  # better bjobs
    busers  # limits
