EXAMPLES
  Adding a new startup mount rule
    sudo blkid -c /dev/null
    # note the UUID for the relevant partition
    sudo vim /etc/fstab
    # Add the following line, replacing as appropriate
    # UUID=19106113-2fd3-4441-a0a7-ff30ab5cdc85  /media/storage1  ext4  defaults  0       0
          # This mounts the partition at /media/storage
          # see "Permissions"

  Unmounting a partition
    sudo umount /media/storage1

  Remounting all the partitions according to /etc/fstab
    sudo mount -a

  Permissions
          # fstab options for ntfs, (fat?) allow to set uid=daniel,
          # gid=users,umask=022
          # umask being 777 minus octal permissions (see ~/man/chmod.txt)
          # for ext4, option user=daniel exists, but doesn't seem to work.
          # What works (it only needs to be done once):
    sudo chown daniel:users -R /media/storage1
    sudo chmod 744 /media/storage1
