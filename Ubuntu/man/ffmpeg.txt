EXAMPLES
  Converting a video to a .gif
    mkdir frames
    ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -r 20 'frames/frame-%03d.jpg'
          # -r [N] for [N] fps
    convert -resize 768x576 -delay 5 -loop 0 frames/*.jpg video.gif
          # -resize is useful for reducing filesize
          # -delay [N] with [N] = 100/fps
          # -loop 0 to loop forever

  Scale a video
    ffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=852:480 output.avi
          # scale=852:-1   to preserve the aspect ratio

  Rotate a video
    ffmpeg -i in.mov -vf "transpose=1" out.mov
          # transpose:
          #   0 = 90CounterCLockwise and Vertical Flip (default)
          #   1 = 90Clockwise
          #   2 = 90CounterClockwise
          #   3 = 90Clockwise and Vertical Flip

  Speed up / Slow down a video
    ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter:v "setpts=0.5*PTS" -an output.mkv
          #      this multiplies all timestamps by 0.5, making the video
          #      2x as fast, without interpolation.
          #      frames are skipped in order to keep framerate.
          # -an  disables the audio stream 

NOTES
  Experimental codecs
    # Getting this kind of error?
    #   "The encoder 'aac' is experimental but experimental codecs
    #    are not enabled, add '-strict -2' if you want to use it."
    # -strict -2 needs to be added right before the last parameter
    ffmpeg -i infile -strict -2 outfile
